`RemovePodsViolatingNodeTaints` strategy makes sure that pods violating NoSchedule taints on nodes are removed. For example there is a pod "podA" with a toleration to tolerate a taint key=value:NoSchedule scheduled and running on the tainted node. If the node's taint is subsequently updated/removed, taint is no longer satisfied by its pod's tolerations and will be evicted.

Node taints can be excluded from consideration by specifying a list of excludedTaints. If a node taint key or key=value matches an excludedTaints entry, the taint will be ignored.

### Deploy the sample App

```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image nginx
```

Verify the deployment is in running state

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide --selector app=nginx
```
Output will look like:
{{< output >}}
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP             NODE                                         NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
nginx-6799fc88d8-k46jv   1/1     Running   0          14s   10.14.10.209    ip-10-14-10-225.us-west-2.compute.internal   <none>           <none>
{{< /output >}}

### Attach a taint to the node

Lets find the node where the nginx pod is scheduled

```bash
export FIRST_NODE_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l app=nginx -o json | jq -r '.items[0].spec.nodeName')
echo $FIRST_NODE_NAME
```

Output will look like:

{{< output >}}
ip-10-14-10-225.us-west-2.compute.internal
{{< /output >}}

Now, apply the  `dedicated=team1` taint to the node.

```bash
# add the taint to the node
kubectl taint nodes ${FIRST_NODE_NAME} dedicated=team1:NoSchedule
```

Output will look like:
{{< output >}}
node/ip-10-14-10-225.us-west-2.compute.internal tainted
{{< /output >}}

We can verify that it worked by re-running the `kubectl describe node` command.

```bash
kubectl describe node $FIRST_NODE_NAME | grep Taint
```

Output will look like:

{{< output >}}
Taints:             dedicated=team1:NoSchedule
{{< /output >}}


Descheduler will evict the nginx pod in the next run as it no longer tolerate the new taint applied to the node. Kube scheduler will kick in and schedule the pod to an untained node.

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

Output will look like:

{{< output >}}
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP             NODE                                         NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
nginx-6799fc88d8-8zss2   1/1     Running   0          16s   10.14.11.252   ip-10-14-11-249.us-west-2.compute.internal   <none>           <none>
{{< /output >}}

Notice the `Node` is changed in the above output. You can also look at the descheduler logs for more analysis

```bash
kubectl logs -n kube-system deployment/descheduler
```
